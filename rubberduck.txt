Battleship Project.

1. Assingment.

1.1. According to my understanding of this step, I created a constructor with length, hit and sunk parameters and created this.length = length, this.hit = hit, and this.sunk=sunk; properties.

Hmmm, when I checked the instruction again, I see that it says "the number of times they've been hit" and "whether or not they've been sunk". It seems to be now that I may use wrong properties although I am not sure.

2. From what I understand by this step that I need to test the class via an instance.

3. return $'this.hit' ++;

4.if the length of the ship is equal to the size of hits then the ship should be considered sunk.
